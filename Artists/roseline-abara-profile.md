## Origin & Backstory

Roseline Abara was a market singer and traveling storyteller from the Igbo-speaking region of southeastern Nigeria, working through the 1950s and into the early 1970s — the years when Lagos was becoming a city that could hold everything at once: highlife and jazz, tradition and ambition, the old world and the new one jostling each other in the same street market on the same Tuesday afternoon.

She was not a griot by birth — the griot tradition belongs to the Mandé-speaking peoples of West Africa, and she was Igbo, and she would have been the first to correct you. What she was, in her own words and in the words of the market, was an *akụkọ ifo* woman: a woman of the old stories. The *akụkọ ifo* are Igbo fables — morality tales in the tradition of the spider Mbe, whose cleverness is both the lesson and the entertainment, who wins not by being strong but by thinking faster than everyone else in the room.

She performed in markets, at naming ceremonies, at school festivals, and at the weddings of people who had heard about her from someone who had heard about her from someone else. She had no manager and no record deal and no fixed address. She had a reputation that moved faster than she did.

What made her different from other storytellers was the music. She accompanied herself on a small guitar — not the talking drum or the udu or any instrument that would have placed her cleanly inside a tradition, but a guitar, which she had learned from a cousin who had learned it from a Ghanaian highlife musician who had learned it from no one in particular. On this guitar she played jazz chords she had developed by listening to Willis Jackson records on a radio in Port Harcourt and working backward from what she heard to what her fingers could find. The result was something that belonged entirely to her: Igbo fable melody on jazz harmony, performed with the rhythmic intelligence of someone who grew up where drumming is not a special occasion but the language the air speaks.

Children loved her immediately and completely. Adults loved her because her children's songs had layers that revealed themselves over time — a joke on the surface, a truth in the middle, something quietly devastating at the bottom. She never talked down to children. She believed, and said often, that children understood everything and merely lacked the vocabulary to explain what they understood. Her songs gave them the vocabulary.

She recorded exactly one album, in 1968, at a studio in Lagos that was also a radio repair shop and may not have been either. The engineer was nineteen years old and working from instinct. The album was pressed in a run of 300 copies. Fela Kuti is said to have owned one. Whether he said anything about it is not recorded.

The civil war — the Biafra conflict, 1967 to 1970, which killed between one and three million people in the region she came from — interrupted everything. She survived it. What the war did to her music, to her itinerary, to her willingness to perform for strangers, is not documented in any source that has been found. What is documented is that she reappeared in Lagos markets in 1972, guitar in hand, performing to children as if no time had passed. The songs were the same. Something in the way she told them was different. The children didn't notice. The adults did.

She performed until at least 1981. After that, the trail ends. The Lagos market where she most often worked was redeveloped. The people who remembered her moved on. The single album, long out of print, circulates in digital form on forums dedicated to rare African music, where it is described in threads with titles like *who is this* and *why does this feel like something I already knew.*

## Vocal Style

A bright, clear mezzo with a speaking voice that is never far away — she moves between singing and storytelling the way a river moves between wide and narrow, without announcing the transition, because in her understanding they are the same thing at different speeds. Her tone has warmth without heaviness: present and immediate, the voice of someone performing in an open market who has learned to carry without shouting, to project through personality rather than volume.

She sings to children the way the best teachers teach: with complete conviction that what she is saying matters, which makes the child believe it matters too.

Her ornamentation is spare and precise — a grace note here, a bent pitch there, drawn from the melodic patterns of Igbo folk song rather than any classical tradition. She does not over-decorate. She trusts the melody. When she does ornament, it is always in service of the word — she bends toward a syllable the way you lean toward something interesting.

Her rhythmic intelligence is the defining feature. She phrases with the beat and against it and across it, sometimes all three in the same line, in a way that feels like play but is actually structural. She learned this from the market, where every vendor is performing rhythm simultaneously and you have to find your own pattern inside the crowd's noise. Her jazz phrasing is not borrowed from American records — it is arrived at independently, from the same root logic, because jazz and the griot tradition share a common understanding that rhythm is not decoration but argument.

In faster songs she is mischievous — her voice carries a smile even on lines that are not funny, because she knows something you don't yet, and she's deciding whether to tell you. In slower songs she settles into warmth, a quality like late afternoon sun through a market canopy: golden, specific, temporary, completely sufficient.

A bright West African mezzo whose singing and speaking exist on a single unbroken continuum — she narrates and sings and narrates again without seam, because in the *akụkọ ifo* tradition the story and its music are not two things. Her tone is warm and forward, built for open air and intimate rooms equally, carrying jazz pop phrasing through the rhythmic logic of West African market music. She is never solemn. She is occasionally profound. She knows the difference and chooses when to be which.

## Sound

The production is midtempo jazz pop with a West African rhythmic foundation — not slow, not frantic, but moving at the pace of a good story: fast enough to hold attention, measured enough to let the details land.

The guitar is central and constant: clean jazz chords, slightly trebly, played with a lightness that is deceptive — the voicings are sophisticated, the touch makes them sound inevitable. Underneath it, percussion drawn from both traditions: a jazz ride cymbal and a talking drum in conversation, neither one dominating, both creating a groove that feels simultaneously like a swing feel and like something that predates swing by several centuries. Bass is present and melodic — not just a foundation but a character, occasionally answering her vocal lines with a phrase of its own.

Horns appear on certain tracks, in the highlife tradition: bright, punchy, arranged in short stabs rather than long lines, punctuating rather than accompanying. On children's songs the horns are more playful, landing on the funny beats, underlining the jokes.

The production is dry and present — minimal reverb, the room close, the voice forward. This is not a sound that reaches for grandeur. It reaches for the sensation of being in the front row of something good, which is better.

There are recordings — the ones from 1968 — where you can hear the market in the distance. Not intrusive, not foregrounded, just present the way context is present: the sound of where this music came from and where it lives.

## Lyrical Themes

- The spider Mbe, who is never the strongest creature in the story and is always the one who wins.
- Animals who believe their power protects them, and the small clever things that prove it doesn't.
- Children who ask questions adults don't want to answer, and the answers anyway.
- The market as a universe — everything available, everything negotiated, nothing free but nothing without value.
- Cleverness as a form of kindness: outsmarting someone as a way of teaching them something they needed to know.
- The gap between what a thing looks like and what it is.

Her fable songs do not moralize — they demonstrate. The moral arrives the way a punchline arrives: you didn't see it coming and then it was the only possible ending. Children laugh. A moment later they understand why, which is a different and more durable thing.

She also writes tenderness without sentimentality: songs about mothers and market days and the specific color of evening in a hot-weather city, songs that treat childhood as a serious subject rather than a simple one.

## Influences

**Fela Kuti's rhythmic architecture** — not his politics or his instrumentation but his understanding that groove is an argument, that the way a rhythm is constructed makes a claim about the world.

**E.T. Mensah and the highlife tradition** — the Ghanaian bandleader who made jazz and West African popular music into the same thing in the 1950s. Roseline's guitar vocabulary lives inside the space he opened.

**The Igbo *akụkọ ifo* oral tradition** — the fable form itself: the spider hero, the morality embedded in entertainment, the audience that is children but is really everyone.

**Miriam Makeba** — her ability to carry complete cultural identity into a voice that crossed every border, to be entirely specific and entirely universal simultaneously. Roseline does not imitate her. She learned from her that it was possible.

## AI Music Generation Reference Prompt

> A midtempo Afro jazz pop track built on clean jazz guitar (sophisticated chord voicings, light touch), talking drum and jazz ride cymbal in conversation, melodic upright bass, and occasional highlife horn stabs. A bright West African mezzo vocalist moves freely between sung melody and spoken storytelling — warm, rhythmically playful, slightly mischievous, always forward in the mix. The mood is lively and intelligent: the energy of a good story being told in a market, to children who are paying complete attention because they suspect something is about to happen. Production is dry and present, minimal reverb, the voice close. The faint sound of an open-air market lives at the very bottom of the mix, barely audible, always there.

## Artist Bio
*(for DistroKid / streaming platforms)*

Roseline Abara was a market singer, guitarist, and *akụkọ ifo* storyteller from southeastern Nigeria, working in the years when Lagos held everything — highlife and jazz, tradition and the future, the spider fables of the Igbo oral tradition and the jazz harmonics she reverse-engineered from a Willis Jackson record in Port Harcourt.

She recorded one album in 1968, in a studio that was also a radio repair shop, with a nineteen-year-old engineer and no plan beyond getting it right. She performed for children because she believed children understood everything and merely needed someone to tell them in a language they could use.

Her songs are not simple. Her songs are about the spider who wins without being strong, the lion who loses without being wrong, the child who asks the question the room was hoping no one would ask. They are funny first, true second, and the second thing arrives before the laughter is finished.

Her debut album *Mbe and the Morning Market* has been described, on the forums where rare African music is traded and mourned, as *the sound of something I knew before I knew I knew it.* She would consider that a successful outcome. She was always interested in what children carry without knowing they are carrying it. She made songs to give it shape.
