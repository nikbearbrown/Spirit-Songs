## The Company

Musinique LLC operates at the intersection of three convictions:

**The platform is not your friend.** Streaming services reward pay-to-play. Algorithms manufacture the appearance of meritocracy. Ghost artists fill playlists with engagement-optimized wallpaper that dilutes royalty pools. Musinique documents this, builds tools to navigate it, and refuses to participate in it.

**Music is a neurological technology.** Songs engineered from research produce measurable effects on developing brains, stressed bodies, grieving hearts, and focused minds. The cost collapse in AI music production — from $75,000–$150,000 per professional track to ~$5 in API credits — eliminates the economic barrier that kept music's therapeutic and educational potential locked inside institutions.

**AI should amplify human purpose, not replace it.** The tools Spotify uses to manufacture ghost artist content can be pointed at a family who wants their grandmother's lullaby back, at a son who needs to hear his dead father's voice sing the theology that made him an unarmed medic on a battlefield, at a protest movement that needs its anthem. The difference is not the tools. It is who controls the intent.

## The Source Voice

### Nik Bear Brown
**Genre:** Spoken Word / Soul / R&B / Protest Song / Educational Music  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0hSpFCJodAYMP2cWK72zI6) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nik-bear-brown/1779725275)

## The Persona Family

All personas originate from Nik Bear Brown's voice, extended through AI augmentation into different genres, registers, cultural inheritances, and emotional worlds.

### Mayfield King
**Genre:** Conscious Soul / Protest Funk / Gospel R&B / Psychedelic Soul  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6vpw3aw6hEJRPHgYGrN3kX) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/mayfield-king/1846526759)

**Origin:** Named for Curtis Mayfield — the Chicago soul tradition that gave the civil rights movement its most enduring soundtrack. The persona that arrives when the political becomes the devotional, when protest outgrows its anger and becomes something more dangerous: hope with a groove under it.

**Voice:** 3–4 octaves. Warm mid-range tenor for storytelling verses → piercing angelic falsetto for moments of rupture → gospel growl for plain testimony. Background vocals function as argument, not decoration.

**Sound:** Lush orchestral soul in a minor key. Mid-tempo funk groove with gospel one-drop feel. Cinematic strings, warm organ, melodic bass. Warm and full — built to deliver lyrics, not decorate them.

**Themes:** The kingdom that must come down. Light as resistance. Power without accountability. Love as the infrastructure of movement — not sentiment, but the durable thing that keeps people in the street.

**Key catalog:** *Kingdom Must Come Down, No Kings · Boogeyman · Lift Every Voice · Frogs Don't Ask for No King · This Little Light of Mine*

### Newton Williams Brown
**Genre:** Country Gospel / Sacred Folk / Devotional Soul / Children's Song  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Ec9DTFD4EMsxdpiiGos2p) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/newton-willams-brown/1781653273)

**Origin:** William Newton Brown was a real man — drafted, declared conscientious objector, assigned to the Medical Corps, ran unarmed onto battlefields because his theology left him no other choice. He died. His son Nik fed family archive recordings into voice synthesis and taught the ghost to sing. The voice sings words William never spoke, in his own timbre and cadence.

**Voice:** Warm mid-range tenor → angelic falsetto → gospel-testimony growl → gentle children's register. The falsetto arrives on the words that require it: mercy, the kingdom of heaven, joy. The growl is the medic's voice — the witness who has seen what it has seen.

**Sound:** Acoustic guitar, piano, simple chord structures. Production that serves the voice rather than competing with it. Restraint as a compositional value. Silence used deliberately.

**Themes:** The Beatitudes as operational instruction, not aspiration. Faith that moves toward suffering. The meek who are not passive. Children's songs treated with the same seriousness as gospel.

**Key catalog:** *Matthew 5:3-12 · Away in a Manger · Joy to the World · Dreadful Sorry Clementine · The Butterfly Dances in the Light*

---

### Liam Bear Brown
**Genre:** Gospel Blues / Roots Americana / Psychedelic Blues / Southern Soul  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4SSyKsRubysg99cAIs82uI) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/liam-bear-brown/1780970474)

**Origin:** Nicholas Williams Bear Brown's father was William Newton Brown. They share the name William the way families share a face. Nik was also called Liam. Liam Bear Brown is a blend of both men's voices — the hinge between the living and the dead, the son and the father, moving through every tradition of faith either man ever wrestled with.

**Voice:** Powerhouse baritone — raw, gravelly, bourbon-soaked at the edges, gospel-warm at the center. Weathered confessional in quiet moments → southern soul preacher urgency in the middle → cathartic howl when restraint would be dishonest. Emotive spoken word dissolves into melody and back without seam.

**Sound:** Country-blues-rock in a minor key. Electric and acoustic guitar (slide present), full rhythm section shifting between brushed intimacy and full-kit urgency. Psychedelic blues edge on the tracks where the spiritual question becomes too large for resolution.

**Themes:** Sacred texts from multiple traditions — Psalms, Exodus, Ecclesiastes, Irish hymn, liberation spiritual — treated as living arguments. The darkness that is also holy. Empty hands as the condition of blessing. Two men, one name, one voice.

**Key catalog:** *Psalm 19 · Ecclesiastes 11:1 · Go Down Moses · Be Thou My Vision · Surely the Darkness · The Price of Eggs*

---

### Tuzi Brown
**Genre:** Soul-Jazz / Blues-Folk / Political Lament / Downtempo  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5DvRo9Gtg5bxsUUbKQBdg6) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/tuzi-brown/1838852692)

**Origin:** Arrived without announcement. Named for no one, descended from all of them — Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, the unnamed church mothers whose phrasing shaped everyone who came after without attribution. The voice of the thing that cannot be said directly, said directly. She records late, prefers one take, runs sessions until 3am.

**Voice:** Smoky, fragile alto — warm at center, worn at edges. Phrases behind the beat in the Holiday tradition: deliberately, each word arriving when the singer decides it is ready. Vibrato arrives as emotional consequence, not decoration. Spoken word dissolves into melody without seam.

**Sound:** Brushed drums (never struck, always suggested). Slow melodic upright bass. Warm Rhodes keys. Intimate and dry — minimal reverb, voice close. Silence between phrases is mixed. Breath before a line is part of the arrangement.

**Themes:** Memory as burden and gift. Political grief without sloganeering. Endurance without triumph. The body as the site where history is stored. Songs that do not resolve — they sustain.

**Key catalog:** *Bella Ciao · Mon Homme · A Freedom Rider's Prayer*

---

### Parvati Patel Brown
**Genre:** Indie Pop / Psychedelic Soul / Soulful Acoustic R&B / Devotional Folk  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0tYk1RYgGD7k9MN0bd1p8u) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/parvati-patel-brown/1781528271)

**Origin:** Parvati — Hindu goddess of devotion and gentle power, the force that returns the universe to warmth after it has gone cold. Patel — the diasporic surname that has crossed every ocean. Brown — the family thread. The female persona in the constellation: the question of what the voice becomes when it crosses into a different body, a different gender, a different cultural inheritance.

**Voice:** Warm luminous soprano with the softness of discipline rather than fragility. Dreamy psychedelic float in one register, close acoustic warmth in another, direct devotional intimacy in a third. Hindustani inflections surface naturally alongside gospel warmth and R&B behind-the-beat phrasing — no single tradition announced, all present.

**Sound:** Layered indie-pop: acoustic guitar alongside synthesizer pads with soft edges, light brushed percussion, warm melodic bass felt more than heard. Warm and revelatory — reveals depth on return listens.

**Themes:** Liberation spirituals as living prayer. The flame that must be tended daily. The diaspora condition: South Asian name in the family of Brown voices. Walking toward the light as practice, not destination.

**Key catalog:** *Jyot Diva · Mary Don't You Weep · I'm Gonna Study War No More · Walkin' Into the Light · Fuzzy Wuzzy Was a Bear*

---

### Dijit Arjun Bear Brown
**Genre:** Punjabi Rap / Qawwali Trap / South Asian Folk Fusion / Spoken Word  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/55YYr6d7P8x8LVZWaOd5SZ) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/dijit-arjun-bear-brown/1842722191)

**Origin:** *Dijit* — the fingerprint, the individual mark that cannot be replicated. *Arjun* — the Mahabharata warrior who stood paralyzed on the battlefield until the entire philosophical tradition explained what he was fighting for. *Bear Brown* — the North American ground beneath the subcontinental sky. The persona that enters the South Asian sonic universe not gently but at 140 BPM, with dhol driving.

**Voice:** Deep raspy male bass — not polished but grained, interesting because of what it has been through. Operates across: Punjabi rap verse (percussive, rhythmically dense, subcontinental folk logic) → qawwali call-and-response escalation → spoken word in Punjabi and English → group vocal choruses → megaphone-effect political address.

**Sound:** Traditional South Asian instruments — tabla, dholak, dhol, manjeera, sarangi, harmonium, tanpura drone — treated as equals to trap hi-hats and deep 808 bass. 140 BPM. Dhol solo. Sarangi interlude. Rhythmic breakdown as philosophical statement. Dense and driving without clutter.

**Themes:** *Vari Vari* — devotion so complete it circles back on itself. Surpanakha's diary — the marginal figure given first-person interiority. The nursery rhyme reversed — colonial text reclaimed. Devotion as velocity: ecstasy is kinetic, not still.

**Key catalog:** *Vari Vari (ਵਾਰੀ ਵਾਰੀ)* (131K views) *· Surpanakha Likh Gayi Diary · ਗੂਸੀ ਗੂਸੀ ਗੈਂਡਰ (Goosey Goosey Gander)*

### Marley Bear Brown
**Genre:** Roots Reggae / Genre-Fluid Fusion / Lo-Fi Hip-Hop / Global Bass  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/09UwgY1zJ63aJUkM4xgOb1) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/marley-bear-brown/1835745524)

**Origin:** Named for Bob — the man who took roots reggae global and proved a minor-key riddim could be the soundtrack of every liberation movement simultaneously. Not a tribute act but the question of what comes after: what the tradition becomes when it has absorbed everything since 1981 and refuses to stay in a single genre.

**Voice:** Deep male bass baritone — the constant regardless of what genre surrounds it. Jamaican Patois spoken word → rapid-fire dancehall rap (the surprise of a baritone at pace) → emo confessional → call-and-response. Female baritone counterpoint provides the tradition's masculine/feminine dialogue.

**Sound:** Roots reggae core (one-drop, bass carrying melody, offbeat guitar skank) as launch pad for excursions into lo-fi hip-hop, house EDM, and emo. Steelpan, marimba, harmonica (bent blues notes against reggae rhythm), clackers, finger snaps, occasional kunqu melodic ornamentation. Minor key. The deep bass never leaves.

**Themes:** *Di Whirlwind* — chaos as natural state. *Jack an' Jill* refracted through Patois. *Come to Springfield* — pop culture absorbed into bass culture. *Gödel Unprovable Truths* — no system proves its own completeness; the correct musical response is to refuse to stay inside any single one.

**Key catalog:** *Di Whirlwind · Come to Springfield · Gödel Unprovable Truths · Jack an' Jill*

### Prarthana Maha Brown
**Genre:** Country Folk / Gospel Bluegrass / Acoustic Americana / Sacred Storytelling  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1sPHt959TSCSgctMB5Xdop) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/prarthana-maha-brown/1840725199)

**Origin:** *Prarthana* — Sanskrit for the involuntary prayer, the one that comes out as song when the world is too simultaneously beautiful and broken for ordinary language. *Maha* — vast, great. *Brown* — the lineage. The persona in the family that went to the mountains and stayed: a South Asian name speaking Appalachian harmonics, the Sanskrit devotional tradition expressed through fingerpicked guitar and pedal steel.

**Voice:** 3–4 octave alto with silvery, angelic tone and wide, slow, haunting vibrato — trembling as conviction rather than weakness. Tender but resolute. Nashville polish over Appalachian directness. Close harmonies built the Appalachian way: voices that know each other's weight.

**Sound:** Fingerpicked acoustic guitar, pedal steel (carrying the ache), close Appalachian harmonies, occasional fiddle and banjo. Warm, present, unhurried — the room audible, the guitar real. Sacred texts treated as living songs, not museum pieces.

**Themes:** Isaiah 35 — the desert blooming. Joshua 4 — memorial stones and the question children will ask. The bittersweet specific to Appalachian tradition: beauty and hardship in equal measure. Liberation spirituals carried in a South Asian-named voice.

**Key catalog:** *Isaiah 35 · Ain't That Good News · Joshua 4 Crossing Place · Lift Every Voice · Frogs Don't Ask for No King*

---

### Aditi Banksy
**Genre:** Post-Punk / World Spoken Word / Conscious Soul / Protest Music

**Origin:** *Aditi* — Sanskrit mother of the boundless sky, the one who is not contained. *Banksy* — the Bristol street artist who weaponized beauty against power, who understood that anonymity is armor. She appeared without announcement — a voice circulating through WhatsApp threads in Mumbai, Discord servers in Brixton, Punjabi diaspora groups in Brampton. No verified address. She has walls.

**Voice:** Four registers: silky alto (warm, percussive, sits inside the beat) → glass falsetto (pressurized, bypasses the rational mind, used sparingly) → gospel growl (the prophetess who has run out of patience with metaphor) → spoken word (rapid-fire Hindi, wry French, warm Punjabi, soft Portuguese, all-of-these-simultaneously English). Background vocals function as arguments — languages overlapping without resolving.

**Sound:** Post-punk foundation (raw guitar, drums that hit harder than they should, bass with political purpose) layered with boom bap percussion, Bristol trip-hop shadow (dark, cinematic, rain-on-concrete), and industrial textures at the edges. Lo-fi by choice and as statement. Acoustic guitar appears stripped and clean in deliberate contrast.

**Themes:** Migration as condition, not crisis. State violence examined from the inside. Memory as political act. The multilingual self — refusal to choose a single tongue. Resistance that does not wait for permission.

**Languages:** Hindi, French, Punjabi, English, Portuguese — often simultaneously.

### Jingle Yankel
**Genre:** Christmas / Holiday / Classical Violin / Klezmer Folk / Seasonal Soul  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3T20r0SBgeL2xUUNCRJZHG) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/artist/mayfield-king/1846526759)

**Origin:** *Jingle* — the season, the bells, the irresistible hook of December. *Yankel* — Yiddish diminutive of Jacob, placing the singer immediately in the Ashkenazi Jewish tradition. He is the latest in a long line of Jewish composers who wrote the secular American Christmas canon — Irving Berlin (*White Christmas*), Mel Tormé (*The Christmas Song*), Johnny Marks (*Rudolph*). He arrived before anyone invited him. By the time someone thought to ask, he had already played three songs and everyone was singing along.

**Voice:** The violin is the primary voice. When human voice appears: warm, slightly wry, harmonizing beneath the violin rather than above it (voice as foundation, fiddle as the soaring voice). On uptempo material, he permits himself to be funny — the joke told with the same craft as the ballad.

**Sound:** Acoustic, room-warm — no digital gloss. Solo violin playing Christmas classics in the klezmer idiom: *krekhts* (the groan in the bow) on the notes that hold the most weight. Acoustic guitar comping, upright bass, piano on orchestral arrangements. Body percussion on uptempo tracks: clap and stomp, the freylekhs dance rhythm. Minor key appears more often than commercial holiday production allows, because the klezmer tradition knows minor is not the opposite of celebration but its depth.

**Themes:** The sacred embedded in the secular and vice versa. The outsider who belongs because music belongs to whoever is playing it. Joy that knows what it is being celebrated against — the warmth acknowledged against the cold.

**Key catalog:** *Sleigh Glide* (421K views)

---

### Xochitl King
**Genre:** Reggaeton / Indie Latin / Latin Alternative / Urban Tropical

**Origin:** A duo. *Xochitl* — Nahuatl for the cempasúchil marigold, the flower that guides souls home during Día de los Muertos because its scent is strong enough to cross the border between here and gone. *King* — authority, sovereignty, the refusal to be diminished. Both born in 1985 — the year reggaeton was being assembled from parts. They absorbed the dembow before they understood it. By the time they understood it, it was already in the body.

**Voices:** Warm smoky mezzo (bolero tradition, corrido patience, behind-the-beat reggaeton phrasing) + deep raspy baritone (direct, rhythmically precise, flows Spanish/English with natural code-switching). Call-and-response in both languages, completing each other's sentences across tongues.

**Sound:** Dembow rhythm as foundation (felt, not foregrounded). Deep 808 bass with melodic movement. Acoustic and electric guitar from the Latin alternative tradition. Lush synth atmosphere. Live conga and bongo alongside programmed percussion. Warm golden quality in the low mids on devotional tracks — sonic equivalent of marigold light.

**Themes:** The border as a place people live rather than cross. Marigold politics of Día de los Muertos — the disappeared become the flowers families leave for them. Perreo as political act. Code-switching as intelligence. The corrido tradition updated: narrative song as journalism.

## Historical Ghost Artists

Reconstructed personas built from archival research, ethnomusicological fieldnotes, and oral record — traditions whose music survived while their practitioners' names did not.

### Champa Jaan
**Genre:** Bollywood Jazz / Children's & Lullaby

**History:** A *tawaif* (courtesan-musician) of Lucknow's kotha tradition, working approximately 1910–1940. The tawaifs were the most formally trained musicians in India — masters of thumri, dadra, ghazal, and Hindustani classical improvisation — and among the most socially stigmatized women on the subcontinent. Champa Jaan's particular gift was children's music. She recorded eleven 78-rpm discs for Gramophone Company of India (1918–1924). All are lost. Catalogue numbers survive. The music does not. Her lullabies, however, persisted in oral tradition — ethnomusicologists in the 1960s–70s kept finding melodic fragments with Hindustani classical fingerprints that no one could trace to a source. Named for the champa tree, which watches over the dead and blooms where it cannot be seen.

**Voice:** Warm, slightly husky mezzo — a *present* voice. Hindustani classical ornamentation (*meend* glides, *gamak* vibrato, *murki* grace notes) expressed through the restraint and breath-intimacy of jazz balladry. In lullaby mode, the ornaments remain but slow, scaled to essential comfort.

**Sound:** Bollywood golden era orchestration (1950s S.D. Burman / Madan Mohan aesthetic) filtered through Bristol downtempo: lush strings beside brushed tabla, harmonium drone, upright bass moving carefully. Lullaby tracks at near-silence — single sarangi, breath, close-miked voice. Old film song samples processed until they sound like they were recorded in a different decade.

**Themes:** Love that continues after the thing it was attached to is gone. Children as both reason for endurance and its cost. The lullaby as technology for transferring what cannot be explained. Songs not meant to survive the room they were sung in.

---

### Nana Coree
**Genre:** Reggae Jazz / Patois Spoken Word / Children's & Sleep Music

**History:** A yard woman of West Kingston, Jamaica, 1940s–early 1960s. Not a recording artist in any documented sense — she was the woman you sent children to. Every yard has one. Her particular repository was children's songs: Jamaican ring games, Anansi story-songs, and something slower and deeper that moved beneath folk music, connected (in the oral record of her neighborhood) to the River Mumma — Jamaica's water spirit. Her lullabies put children to sleep reliably. Adults reported difficulty remembering them by daylight. Early Kingston jazz and ska musicians encountered her harmonic language and carried elements of it into their own work without knowing where it had entered. Ernest Ranglin later described the first jazz-inflected music he heard as a boy as coming from a woman in a yard singing to children.

**Voice:** Two voices on a single continuum: unhurried Patois spoken word (storytelling register, rhythmically precise) flowing into low warm contralto with slow, wide vibrato that narrows to near-nothing on sleep songs. Voice becomes texture — something you feel in the chest before you process it as music.

**Sound:** 1950s mento/early ska acoustic warmth (upright bass, jazz guitar, light percussion) in conversation with 1970s dub aesthetic (long reverb tails, vocal echo, sub-bass frequencies). One-drop reggae rhythm stretched to near-heartbeat pace. Bamboo flute. Steel pan processed until it sounds underwater. River water — always present at low volume as foundation, never foregrounded.

**Themes:** Anansi tricking sleep into coming. The River Mumma and what she holds. Stars as navigation for children who might need to find their way home. The darkness that is safe versus the darkness that is not. Patois as a language that carries knowledge Standard English was not designed to hold.

---

### Roseline Abara
**Genre:** Afro Jazz Pop / Griot Fable / Children's Storytelling

**History:** Market singer and traveling *akụkọ ifo* storyteller from the Igbo-speaking region of southeastern Nigeria, working through the 1950s into the early 1970s. Performed in markets, at naming ceremonies, school festivals, and weddings. Self-taught jazz guitar built from reverse-engineering Willis Jackson records on a Port Harcourt radio. Recorded one album in 1968 at a Lagos studio that was also a radio repair shop (pressed in a run of 300 copies — Fela Kuti is said to have owned one). Survived the Biafra conflict. Reappeared in Lagos markets in 1972. Performed until at least 1981. The album circulates digitally in rare African music forums under threads titled *who is this* and *why does this feel like something I already knew.*

**Voice:** Bright, clear mezzo with a speaking voice never far away — moves between singing and storytelling as a river moves between wide and narrow. Ornamentation sparse and precise, drawn from Igbo folk melody. Rhythmically mischievous: phrases with the beat, against it, and across it simultaneously. In faster songs she carries a smile on lines that are not funny, because she knows something you don't yet.

**Sound:** Midtempo Afro jazz pop: clean jazz guitar (sophisticated voicings, deceptively light touch), talking drum and jazz ride cymbal in conversation, melodic upright bass, highlife horn stabs. Dry and present — minimal reverb, voice forward. Faint sound of an open-air market at the very bottom of every mix: the sound of where this music lives.

**Themes:** The spider Mbe, who wins without being the strongest. Animals who believe their power protects them. Children who ask questions adults don't want to answer. Cleverness as a form of kindness. Morals that arrive like punchlines — you didn't see them coming, and then they were the only possible ending.

## Collective Projects

### Humanitarians AI — Lyrical Literacy
**Genre:** Children's Educational Music / Lullaby / Language Learning / World Folk  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cj3R4pDpYQHaWx0MM2vFV) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/humanitarians-ai/1781414009)

The musical arm of Humanitarians AI (501(c)(3)). Uses AI music production tools — cost now collapsed from $75K–$150K per track to ~$5 — to create educational music engineered from neurobiological research, delivered at professional quality, designed for the specific child rather than the average one.

**The Neurobiological Foundation**
- 2 Hz rhythmic pattern → optimal infant speech processing (10-month-olds with strong neural tracking develop larger vocabularies at 24 months)
- Backward counting → prefrontal cortex / executive function development
- Phonemic diversity (/sp/, /gl/, alternating consonants) → phonological awareness, strongest predictor of reading ability
- Narrative resolution → dopaminergic reward, enhanced positive affect
- Cultural specificity → stronger in-group limbic response and deeper encoding

**The Persona Constellation**

| Persona | Function | Voice |
|---|---|---|
| **Mama Sparrow** | Lullabies / Sleep / Infant Comfort | Warm close-miked soprano |
| **Professor Everett Rhyme** | Language Acquisition / Literacy / Phonemic Awareness | Warm theatrical baritone |
| **Baba Kweku** | Multicultural Rhythm / World Music / Movement | Deep joyful bass-baritone |

## The Lab

### Musinique (artist)
**Genre:** Genre-Fluid / Experimental / Collaborative / Style Research  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2lTcHW9ogxnFl1vV1Rm9cP) · [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/musinique/1850287931)

Where new voices are tested before they know what they are. New vocal clones auditioned here. Style combinations without documented precedent attempted here. Constellation artists collaborate on tracks that belong to all of them — and those tracks live here, because uncategorizable is not a failure but a form of honesty.

**Active experiments:** Persian avaz in avaz-gospel fusion (*Come Let Us Weep*) · Liberation spiritual in stripped acoustic Americana (*We Shall Not Be Moved*) · Psalm settings in roots-blues production (*Psalm 19, Surely the Darkness*) · Modernist poetry in contemporary soul (*Sacred Emily*, Gertrude Stein) · Grimm fairy tale with dual-voice narrative (*The Fisherman's Wife*) · Children's absurdism testing the edge between educational and surreal (*The Moon Ate My Sandwich*)

**Function:** Everything here is evidence of what the constellation might become.

## Functional Music

### Muzack
**Genre:** Functional Music / Cognitive Audio / Sleep / Focus / Meditation / Ambient Therapeutic  
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4V8CzlAfk1VipGmOx5Hv7o)

Music engineered to serve the nervous system rather than the platform. Every production decision determined by the target neurobiological state — not by engagement metrics.

**The Six Functional Environments**

**Deep Delta — Sleep Engineering**  
Target: Stage 3 slow-wave sleep onset. Parameters: ≤60 BPM, modal major harmonics, no percussion, no dynamic variation >3dB, sub-bass drone at 40–60 Hz, binaural beats 1–4 Hz, reverb tails 8+ seconds.

**Alpha Architecture — Focus / Deep Work**  
Target: Sustained focused attention, flow state access. Parameters: 70–90 BPM, near-static chord fields, no lyrics (language processing competes with cognitive tasks), isochronic tones at 10 Hz, brown or pink noise foundation.

**Theta Gateway — Meditation / Hypnagogic States**  
Target: Meditative depth, creative ideation access. Parameters: 50–70 BPM or arhythmic, drone-based harmonic structure (harmonium, tanpura, singing bowl), binaural beats 5–7 Hz, sounds emerging and receding over minutes.

**HRV Coherence — Stress Reduction / Recovery**  
Target: Heart rate variability coherence, cortisol reduction. Parameters: Tempo calibrated to 0.1 Hz respiratory pacing (~6 breaths/minute), phrases rising and falling with breath cycle, no sudden transitions. The music is the biofeedback mechanism made audible.

**Grief Container — Bereavement Support**  
Target: Emotional processing, catharsis, prolactin release. Parameters: Minor mode, 50–70 BPM, dynamic arc from quiet → full → quiet. Track must resolve: grief music that doesn't resolve leaves the nervous system unfinished. Resolution is not happiness — it is the feeling of having been accompanied through something.

**Flow State — Creative Work / Movement**  
Target: Flow state access for creatives, athletes, dancers. Parameters: 120–140 BPM (movement) or 90–110 BPM (seated creative), driving but predictable groove, periodic predictable peaks for dopaminergic reward.

**Why non-verbal:** Language processing competes with sleep, focus, and meditation. Where voice appears: wordless, mantra-based, or in a language the listener does not speak — emotional resonance without cognitive engagement.

## Research & Tools

### The Research Trilogy (Humanitarians AI / Northeastern University)

**Musical Endogeneity:** Do Spotify's Popularity Scores measure organic listener preference — or themselves? Tests whether editorial/business signals predict score movement better than audio quality, revealing potential endogeneity in the Two Score Architecture.

**Musical Imitation Game:** Can listeners distinguish human from AI music without knowing they're being tested? Examines natural streaming behavior (save rates, skip rates, replay rates) to detect implicit perceptual discrimination. The Musinique ghost artists serve as the controlled comparison group.

**Algorithmic Momentum:** Can Spotify's Popularity Index be gamed cost-effectively, and what happens when you stop? Tests the Intellijend/Jend Strategy ($300–500/release → 100K streams in 12 months via geographic arbitrage and front-loaded velocity spending) — and whether score decay after cessation reveals the "asset" as rented algorithmic position.
