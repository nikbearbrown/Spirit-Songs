## Origin & Backstory

Nana Coree was a yard woman of Kingston, Jamaica — one of those women whose formal name no one used, whose given name receded behind the title the neighborhood gave her, and whose title was earned rather than assigned. She lived in the yards of West Kingston through the 1940s, 50s, and into the early 60s, in the years before Trenchtown became famous and after it had already become hard.

She was not a recording artist in any documented sense. She was the woman you sent children to.

Every yard has one — the grandmother figure who is not necessarily anyone's grandmother, who sits at the threshold of domestic and communal space, who carries in her mouth the entire musical memory of her community. Nana Coree's particular repository was children's songs: Jamaican ring games, Anansi story-songs, lullabies pulled from the rural parishes her mother had come from, and something else — something that moved slower and deeper than folk music, that she sang when children couldn't sleep or when the night felt wrong.

The source of that something else was, according to the yard, the River Mumma.

The River Mumma is Jamaica's water spirit — a mermaid figure who lives at the bottom of rivers and holds their secrets, their treasure, and their power. She is beautiful, she is dangerous, she is not to be disturbed. But she is also, in some regional traditions, a teacher. Women who spent time near rivers — washing, fetching, praying — sometimes came back knowing songs they had not known before. Nana Coree's family came from the banks of the Black River in St. Elizabeth. She had spent her childhood there. She never explained where her slower songs came from, and no one asked directly.

Her lullabies were different from the folk songs: more chromatic, stranger in their intervals, built over drones that seemed to come from somewhere below the melody rather than behind it. Children fell asleep to them reliably, even children who could not otherwise be settled. Adults in the yard reported that the songs were difficult to remember afterward — they knew they had heard them, knew they had felt something, could not retrieve the melody by daylight.

The ska and early reggae musicians of Kingston's emerging scene encountered her — the yards were small and music moved through them — and some of them carried elements of her harmonic language into their own work without quite knowing where it had entered. Ernest Ranglin later said in an interview that the first jazz-inflected music he remembered hearing as a boy was not from a radio or a recording but from a woman in a yard who sang to children in a way that didn't make sense to him until he heard Thelonious Monk years later. He did not give her name. He may not have known it.

Nana Coree's yard is no longer there. Urban redevelopment, then political violence, then more redevelopment. The children she sang to are old now, or gone. Some of them, when they have grandchildren who cannot sleep, find themselves singing something — a phrase, a fragment, a pattern of three notes over a drone — that they cannot explain knowing and cannot quite finish. They say it was something they heard as children. They say it worked.

## Vocal Style

Two voices, used in different registers and often in the same song.

The first is her spoken word voice: patois, unhurried, rhythmically precise without being metronomic — the voice of someone who has been telling stories long enough to know exactly where to pause and where to press. She speaks to children the way the best storytellers do: as if they are intelligent enough to handle the real version, with all its weight. The patois is full and unmodified — not softened for outside ears, not translated. The sound of it is part of the meaning.

The second is her singing voice: a low, warm contralto with the specific humid quality of someone who learned to sing outdoors, near water. Her vibrato is slow and wide, like something rocking. When she sings lullabies, she reduces further — less vibrato, more breath, the voice becoming a texture rather than a melody, something you feel in the chest before you process it as music. Her ornamentation is minimal and modal, drawing on Jamaican mento and kumina traditions. She bends notes the way water bends light.

A reggae-jazz lullaby vocal where patois spoken word and contralto singing exist on a single continuum — she moves between them without announcement, the way a river moves between deep and shallow without changing its direction. Her speaking voice carries rhythm the way reggae carries rhythm: not on top of the beat but inside it, slightly behind, completely unhurried. Her singing voice is warm, low, and resonant with a slow, wide vibrato that narrows to near-nothing on sleep songs — becoming breath, becoming drone, becoming the sound of something you can give your weight to. The tone is aged and immediate simultaneously: intimate as a whisper across a yard, ancient as the river it came from.

A female contralto whose phrasing feels carved from water and patience. Her tone, warm as sun on river stone, carries the weight of every child she has ever settled into sleep. She does not perform lullabies. She administers them.

## Sound

The production is built from two eras of Jamaican music in conversation: the acoustic warmth of 1950s mento and early ska — upright bass, jazz-inflected guitar, light percussion — and the dub aesthetic of the 1970s, where echo and reverb became compositional rather than decorative. These two eras are separated by twenty years in history and share a single room in her productions.

Upright bass is the constant — slow, walking, tuned slightly lower than comfortable. Reggae's characteristic one-drop rhythm is present but halved in tempo, stretched until it becomes something closer to a heartbeat than a groove. Jazz guitar comps behind the vocal with the specific restraint of Ernest Ranglin: sophisticated chord voicings played as if they were simple. Horns appear rarely and at a distance, as if from another room or another yard over.

The dub elements are what make it sleep music: deep reverb on the snare that decays for longer than feels normal, echo on the vocal that creates a second singer who is slightly behind and slightly quieter, sub-bass frequencies that are felt before they are heard. Bamboo flute threads through tracks at irregular intervals. Steel pan appears on certain songs, processed until it sounds like it is playing from underwater.

Water sounds — river water specifically, moving water, not rain — thread through every track continuously, at low volume, as foundation rather than effect. They are never foregrounded. They are always there.

## Lyrical Themes

- The Anansi spider who tricks sleep into coming when it would rather stay away.
- The River Mumma and what she holds at the bottom.
- Stars as a navigation system for children who might need to find their way home.
- The yard as a universe.
- The particular darkness that is safe versus the particular darkness that is not, and how to tell them apart.
- Patois as a language that carries knowledge that Standard English was not designed to hold.
- Rest as something that must be earned, negotiated, occasionally outsmarted.

Her spoken word pieces for children are not simple. They assume intelligence and reward attention. They are also extremely funny in ways that do not translate.

## Influences

**Louise Bennett-Coverley (Miss Lou)** — the Jamaican poet and folklorist who spent fifty years insisting that patois was a literary language and children's culture was a serious subject, and was eventually recognized as correct. Nana Coree carries Miss Lou's conviction that speaking to children in their full cultural language is a form of respect.

**Ernest Ranglin** — the Jamaican jazz guitarist whose chord vocabulary braided mento, ska, jazz, and reggae into something that belongs entirely to its own tradition. The jazz-inflected guitar in Nana Coree's productions is in direct conversation with his.

**Lee "Scratch" Perry's dub production methodology** — the use of the studio as an instrument, echo and reverb as compositional choices, the idea that space in a mix is as meaningful as sound.

**Kumina and Nyahbinghi drumming traditions** — Afro-Jamaican spiritual music that underpins reggae's rhythmic architecture and that Nana Coree draws from directly for her modal, drone-based lullaby structures.

## AI Music Generation Reference Prompt

> A slow reggae-jazz lullaby track at half-time tempo, built from upright bass (walking, tuned low), light jazz guitar comping with sophisticated chord voicings, a sparse one-drop drum pattern stretched to near-heartbeat pace, and continuous river water ambience at low volume in the foundation. A warm female contralto alternates between unhurried Jamaican patois spoken word — rhythmically precise, storytelling in register — and low, breath-heavy contralto singing with slow vibrato that narrows to near-nothing. Dub production elements: long reverb tails on percussion, echo on the vocal creating a second, quieter voice, sub-bass frequencies felt before heard. Bamboo flute at distance. The mood is deeply safe, ancient, and gently hypnotic — music that does not ask you to stay awake.

## Artist Bio
*(for DistroKid / streaming platforms)*

Nana Coree is a reggae-jazz vocalist and producer from the yards of West Kingston, working in the tradition of Jamaican women who held community musical knowledge in their bodies rather than their biographies. Her music braids mento warmth, jazz harmony, dub space, and Jamaican patois spoken word into sleep music and children's songs that do not condescend to their audience — small or otherwise.

She is connected, in the oral record of her neighborhood, to the River Mumma: the Jamaican water spirit who lives at the bottom of rivers and knows things that daylight does not.

Her debut album *Black River Lullaby* was submitted for distribution from a Kingston address that, when verified, turned out to be a yard that was demolished in 1967. The upright bass on every track sounds like it was recorded near moving water. The liner notes are written entirely in patois. They have not been translated. The translation, the notes suggest, is the music.

Children fall asleep to it reliably. Adults report that the songs are difficult to remember by morning — they know they heard something, know they felt it, cannot retrieve the melody. This is, apparently, intentional.
